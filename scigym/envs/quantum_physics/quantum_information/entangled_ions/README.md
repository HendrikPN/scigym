# Ion Trap Environment for generating high-dimensional multipartite entanglement

An *OpenAI* `gym` environment where an agent has to apply laser pulses to an 
array of ions in an ion trap in order to generate high-dimensional multipartite
entanglement.

The simulations presented here are based on the paper,
    
+ P. J. Low, B. M. White, A. A. Cox, M. L. Day, C. Senko,
*Practical trapped-ion protocols for universal qudit-based quantum 
computing*,
[arXiv:1907.08569](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08569.pdf) [quant-ph] (2019).

A comprehensive tutorial on how the environment is built can be found
